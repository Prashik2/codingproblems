    1. A sequence of n > 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values of the differences between successive elements take on 
    all possible values 1 through n âˆ’ 1. For example following sequences are jolly sequences
    1 4 2 3
    absolute diff: 3 2 1 
    1 2 4 7 11 16 22 29 37 46 56
    absolute diff: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    2 5 1 3 4
    absolute diff: 3 4 2 1
	  following sequences is not jolly sequences
		1 3 2 4
		absolute diff: 2 1 2
    Write a method to check whether the given sequence is a Jolly jumper or not. 

    2. Given two sorted arrays A and B.
        A is sorted in ascending order.
        B is sorted in descending order.
        The task is to merge them producing Array C in an ascendingly sorted manner Without using any sort utility or sorting algorithm.

    3. Write a program to accept a number and print unique pairs of numbers such that multiplication of the pair is given number
	Input: 24
	Output:
	1 * 24 = 24
	2 * 12 = 24
	3 * 8 = 24
	4 * 6 = 24
    4. find occurrence of an element in a given array.
Input 
array elements: 10, 10, 20, 30, 10
element to find occurrence: 10
Output:
3

    5. Find count of each value in an array
Input 
array elements: 10, 10, 20, 30, 10, 20
Output:
10: 3
20: 2
30: 1

    6. Remove duplicate elements in an array
Input 
array elements: 10, 10, 20, 30, 10, 20
Output:
10, 20, 30

    7. Write functions to convert group of words to
	a.	snake_case
	b.	camelCase 
	c.	PascalCase
example : user login count
	snake_case: user_login_count
	camelCase: userLoginCount
 	PascalCase: UserLoginCount
    
    8. Write a program to check whether a given string is palindrome or not.
    
    9. Write a program to check whether a given string is palindrome or not ignoring character case, white spaces and punctuations.
For example: following are valid palindrome
	A man a plan a canal panama
	Was it a cat I saw?
  
    10. Write a program to reverse array elements

    11. Given the paper size of A0 paper (841 mm x 1189 mm), find length and breadth of AN. Where n > 0.
